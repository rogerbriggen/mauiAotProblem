# mauiAotProblem

Show the System.ExecutionEngineException "Attempting to JIT compile method xxx while running in aot-only mode." on ios release mode.
Make sure to run it on a real device since the simulator does not have the same AOT compiler.

Same or similar as https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/issues/12416
